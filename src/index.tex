\begin{abstract}
Convolutional Neural Networks can be repurposed from their original use case to deliver impressive fingerprint presentation attack-detection accuracy.
This paper explores various options of publicly available machine learning algorithms and transfers their images classifications to differentiate between bona fide and artificial fingerprints.
All networks have their potential evaluated without intrusive modification and after minimal training.

\smallskip
Datasets from the Liveness Detection Competition 2017 were used as training and validation input to give context to the research and compare the results to specialized solutions.
