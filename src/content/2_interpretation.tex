\section{Interpretation}
Larger networks suffer from a complex set of layers and nodes that come with no benefits and even weakens the purpose as the increased calculation time brings inconvenience to the potential user.
Predictions may be disturbed with noise coming from convolutional layers providing data which has little-to-no use for fingerprint presentation attack-detection.

The extreme counterexample is EfficientNetB0 in this experiment.
An impressive overall accuracy coming from a high APCER makes this convolutional neural network a prime starting point for a competitive alternative.
With only 29Mb in size on disk it is small enough to fit on embedded devices as well.
