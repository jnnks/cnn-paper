\section{Conclusion}
Considering the increase in complexity as well as training and prediction times that deep learning networks with many parameters such as VGG16 bring, the lack in detection accuracy is contrary to expectations.
The original purpose of these networks is to analyze and classify real world objects and animals which bring an acceptable detection rate for fingerprint presentations, but lack the precision and accuracy for real world applications.
Smaller networks in particular represent a good foundation to fine tune and develop a solution which is better fitting for the job.
By concentrating on the key features of the fingerprint, like sweat glands or the smooth curvature of ridge lines of the imprint, a much more accurate system can be built.

Image classification has many facets, but the underlying principles are the same for all applications.
Transfer learning is a powerful paradigm that can lead to surprising results when introducing the pre-trained models to new use cases.
Given the small training dataset, much more accurate predictions are expected when using more extensive reference data to further optimize results.
